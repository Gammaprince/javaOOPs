The static keyword in Java is used for memory management mainly. We can apply static keyword with variables, 
methods, blocks and nested classes. The static keyword belongs to the class than an instance of the class.

The static can be:

Variable (also known as a class variable)
Method (also known as a class method)
Block
Nested class

The static variable gets memory only once in the class area at the time of class loading.

Advantages of static variable
It makes your program memory efficient (i.e., it saves memory).

Static method -> You can call static method from class without actually instantiate classs, static method can't call non-static method or non-static variables

Java static block ->
 1 - Is used to initialize the static data member.
 2 - It is executed before the main method at the time of classloading.
 eg-> class A2{  
     static{System.out.println("static block is invoked");}  
     public static void main(String args[]){  
     System.out.println("Hello main");  
     }  
   }  

Some Questions for Interview : 
Q) Can we execute a program without main() method?
Ans) No, one of the ways was the static block, but it was possible till JDK 1.6. Since JDK 1.7, it is not possible to execute a Java class without the main method.


Q) Why is the Java main method static?
Ans) It is because the object is not required to call a static method. If it were a non-static method, JVM creates an object first then call main() method that will lead the problem of extra memory allocation.
